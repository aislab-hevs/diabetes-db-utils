# diabetes-db-utils
Code to clean, compute statistics and represent data from C12 and GDM

[C12DBProcessing](https://github.com/aislab-hevs/diabetes-db-utils/tree/master/C12DBProcessing): takes a csv file like the one in the data folder, and splits it into different files (one per patient). This util also removes duplicates, and computes statistics (mean Â± sd) for the different physiological values.
